Pre-phoenity web site
===

I call this the "pre-Phoenity" web site because it was built around 2002, before there was `phoenity.com` and the Firefox browser was still called 'Phoenix'. The site was originally hosted on `cheeaun.clook.net/phoenix/` - here's [the Internet Archive copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20021203222018/http://cheeaun.clook.net/phoenix/).

And now it's here.

Note that most links are broken and pardon the Web 1.0 design.
